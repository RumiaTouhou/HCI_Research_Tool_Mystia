    "4. Verify Unique Screenshots for Window Titles:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- The cell prepares the data for the bar chart, grouping less significant window titles into an \"Others\" category if there are more than 10 titles.\n",
    "- It creates a bar chart using matplotlib to visualize the number of clicks for each window title.\n",
    "Labels are added to the top of each bar indicating the number of clicks, and the font size for window names below each bar is adjusted to be smaller.\n",
    "- The bar chart is displayed in the notebook and saved as an image file in the \"Analysis Result\" folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar chart visualizes the number of clicks the user performed on different window titles during the session. Each bar represents a window title, with the height of the bar indicating the number of clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Interaction Areas**: Taller bars indicate the applications or windows that received the most clicks. This can help identify the areas where the user was most active.\n",
    "- **Task Intensity**: A high number of clicks on certain applications may suggest task-intensive activities, such as editing, designing, or frequent navigation within the application.\n",
    "- **Click Distribution**: Comparing the number of clicks across different window titles can reveal how the user's attention and interactions are distributed among various applications.\n",
    "- **Potential for Optimization**: Applications or windows with an unexpectedly high number of clicks might be candidates for usability improvements, as they may require too many interactions to accomplish tasks."

    "3. Collect Click and Drag Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cell iterates through the actions, collecting the coordinates, types, and timestamps of clicks and drags.\n",
    "- It ensures that if a click or drag causes a window title change, the click or drag is counted for both the window title before and after the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Load Screenshots and Create Click Maps:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Interaction Hotspots**: Clusters of clicks can reveal areas of high interaction, indicating frequently used features or buttons. This helps identify critical parts of the interface.\n",
    "- **Drag Patterns**: The start and end points of drags, connected by lines, can show how users perform drag-and-drop operations, resize windows, or scroll through content.\n",
    "- **Usability Issues**: Areas with a high density of clicks or drags might indicate usability issues, such as difficult-to-use controls or inefficient navigation paths.\n",
    "- **User Behavior**: By analyzing the spatial distribution of clicks and drags, researchers can understand how users navigate through the application, their typical workflows, and any repetitive actions.\n",
